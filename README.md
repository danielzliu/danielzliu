### Welcome to my github! ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a student pursuing my Master's degree in **Applied Mathematics at KTH Royal Institute of Technology**. I am interested in solving complex mathematical problems using models and algorhitms, with a special interest in **Operations Research and Financial Simulation**. This github page is a compilation of some of the projects I have been working on at school or on my spare time. Hope you enjoy!
